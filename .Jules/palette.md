## 2025-01-24 - Streamlit Dark Theme & Container Styling
**Learning:** Standard CSS `body` selectors often fail to apply background colors in Streamlit when injected via `st.markdown`. Instead, targeting `[data-testid="stAppViewContainer"]` is the reliable convention for application-wide background styling. Additionally, `st.container(border=True)` elements can be consistently styled by targeting `[data-testid="stVerticalBlockBorderWrapper"]`.
**Action:** Always use `[data-testid="stAppViewContainer"]` for background overrides and prefer `st.container(border=True)` for card-like groupings in Streamlit apps.
