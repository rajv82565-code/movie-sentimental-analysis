## 2026-01-31 - Streamlit Semantic HTML Styling
**Learning:** Custom CSS for semantic tags like `h1` and `p` in Streamlit often gets overridden by the default theme. Using `!important` and more specific selectors (like `h1.class`) is necessary to ensure consistent styling.
**Action:** Always use `!important` when overriding Streamlit's default typography or background colors in custom CSS.
